## Blueprint

To make it work as expected, add the following code to your blueprint:

```
fields:
  density:
    label: Keyword Density
    type: density    
    text:
      - my_text
      - my_other_text
    limit: 5
    words: 2
    keywords: my_keywords
  my_text:
    label: My text
    type: textarea
  my_other_text:
    label: My other text
    type: textarea
  keywords:
    label: Keywords
    type: tags
```

### type

It has to be `density` which is this field.

### text

To know from what texts you want the keyword density field to take words from, you need to add some field names, like this:

```
text:
  - my_text
  - my_other_text
```

It will only work with input fields. `textarea` and `text` are input fields.

You can also add a single value like this:

```
text: my_text
```

### limit (optional)

If you don't want a long list of keywords in your keyword density field, you can set a `limit`. Even if you set a limit you can see all the words with a click of a button.

### words (optional)

If you don't set anything it will split the text into single words. You can change it to 2 or 3 words.

### keywords (optional)

With all the words in the list it can be hard to spot the important keywords. To make it easier you can add a `tags` field that you fill with your keywords. The tags (keywords) are highlighted in the density field keyword list.

## Usage

When your blueprint is set up you can try to write something in the fields you have in `text`. Keywords should start to pop up in the keyword density field.
